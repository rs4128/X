# Introduction

## Why basketball?

In short, we are basketball nerds. A shared love of the game brought us both to the topic 
in general. However, sports analytics have traditionally been most associated with 
_baseball_ through [sabermetrics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabermetrics) -- the long established 
empirical analysis of baseball statistics. There is even a movie about baseball stats with Brad Pitt, _Moneyball_.
After all, the game is slow enough that anyone 
could keep track of what the players are doing! Yet, in the sports world, this is changing. Data science is growing in basketball. Even NBA Commissioner Adam Silver has said, 
"Analytics are part and parcel of virtually everything we do now.‚Äù 
Evidence for this exists in the rise of the 3-point shot in modern basketball, as data analysts
figured out this is the more efficient way to win games. 

Since basketball analytics is relatively new, there are still many unanswered questions. 
Furthermore, most analyses are trying to understand to the formula to winning more games. 
So, we wanted to pursue questions that connected basketball players to the greater world. 

We decided on these questions to explore:

1. COVID19 more or less put sports on hold as seasons were paused or canceled entirely. Like other leagues, the NBA 
suspended their season indefinitely in March 2020 after COVID was spiking in the US. However, the NBA was able to 
successfully finish out their season in a unique way. They held 8 regular season games and the playoffs in a 
'bubble' in Orlando, where teams all stayed together with limited interaction to the outside world. So we ask,
**how did the COVID19 pandemic affect overall NBA team performances?**

2. 2020 was also a big year for basketball for another reason, the unfortunate passing of Kobe Bryant, a player widely 
considered to be one of the all time greats. Many players publicly stated the emotional impact of his passing, rocking the 
basketball community. But by looking at the data, **can we see if the death of Kobe Bryant affected their game performance meaningful way?**

3. Finally, although not directly related to any event of 2020, many top players had 
to sit out the 2019-20 season entirely due to injury. Notably, 
Kevin Durant spent his first season in Brooklyn on the bench due to an Achille's tear. 
**In the NBA, is injury related to position or player statistics in some way? Has this changed over time through certain eras of playstyle?**
